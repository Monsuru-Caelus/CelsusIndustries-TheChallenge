Welcome. We're not looking for resumes; we're looking for titans.

Inspired by Alan Turing's approach to finding the brilliant, unconventional minds needed to break Enigma, this challenge is an open audition to find the founding engineers for Caelus Industries. We believe the toughest problems are the only ones worth solving, and this challenge is a microcosm of one of the hardest robotics problems in the world today.

The Mission 
At Celsus Industries, we're on a mission to democratize maritime defense. In a world where naval power often dictates national sovereignty, we are the David in a world of Goliaths, building the slingshot for nations that refuse to be outsmarted.

The Challenge 
This repository contains a lightweight simulation environment featuring a simplified hybrid vehicle with physics for two distinct mediums: "air" and "water." Your mission is to solve one of the two challenges below.

Track 1: The Robotics Engineer (The "Breach & Entry" Problem)
This track focuses on the core physical challenge of our vehicle: mastering the chaotic air-sea boundary.

Objective: Write a control algorithm that enables the simulated vehicle to transition from air to water and back to air successfully.
Tests: Your mastery of control systems, physics, and robotics engineering.
Constraints: You must stay within the specified G-force limits on entry and generate sufficient velocity to breach the surface on exit.

Track 2: The Autonomy/AI Engineer (The "Hunter" Problem)
This track focuses on the brain of our system: the autonomous mission and swarm logic.

Objective: In a multi-agent environment, write the mission logic for a two-drone swarm to autonomously find and "tag" a moving target in the "water" while avoiding dynamic "threats" in the "air."
Tests: Your ability to think in terms of AI, swarm logic, pathfinding, and autonomous strategy.
Constraints: Your solution should be decentralized, with drones making decisions based on their own limited sensor range.

The Rewards 

1.  **The Prize:** The top submission in each track will receive a **$10,000 cash prize**.
2.  **The Conversation:** The top 5 submissions in each track are **guaranteed** a one-on-one deep-dive call with our founder to discuss your approach and the future of autonomous defense.
3.  **The Ultimate Opportunity:** For the best of the best, this is your audition to become a **founding pillar of Caelus Industries**. This isn't a job; it's a ground-floor opportunity to build something of consequence, with a significant equity stake to match.

How to Participate

1.  Fork this repository.
2.  Review the `docs` folder for detailed specifications on the simulation environment and rules.
3.  Choose your track (`/track-1-robotics` or `/track-2-autonomy`).
4.  Code your solution.
5.  Submit your entry before the deadline.

Submission Guidelines

To submit, please create a new private repository containing:
All of your source code.
A brief but comprehensive `writeup.md` file explaining your approach, the trade-offs you made, and how you would improve it given more time.
Add user `Caelus-Challenge-Admin` as a collaborator.
Email a link to your private repo to `Hello@caelusindustries.com` with the subject line "Celsus Challenge Submission: [Track Name] - [Your Name]".

Evaluation Criteria

Submissions will be judged on:
Success Rate & Performance:** How effectively and efficiently does your solution complete the objective?
Robustness: How well does your solution handle edge cases and non-ideal conditions?
Code Quality & Clarity: Is your code clean, well-documented, and well-structured?
Elegance of Approach: The creativity and ingenuity of your solution, as explained in your write-up.

Deadline

All submissions are due by 11:59 PM PT on November 5th, 2025.

Questions?

Please open an `Issue` in this repository with your question. We will respond publicly so all participants can benefit. Good luck.
